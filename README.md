# eFuse Backend Work Sample by John Hansen

## Technologies used

- NestJS
- Prisma
- Mongo
- Redis
- Docker

## Installation

1. Install Docker for your system
    - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
1. Clone down the repository
    ```bash
    git clone tbd
    ```
1. Navigate to the cloned directory
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
1. Install the app dependencies
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
    (Short for `npm install`)



## Running the app

Use Docker Compose to start Nest, MongoDB and Redis.
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

If everything has worked so far, this should start up all the components necessary for the API to work in concert with MongoDB and Redis.
